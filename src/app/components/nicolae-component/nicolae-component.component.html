        <p [hidden]="visibility">In 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,
            Carol
            Danvers rescues Tony
            Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve
            Rogers,
            Thor,
            Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they
            plan
            to
            use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, but discover Thanos has already destroyed them to
            prevent
            further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.

            Five years later, in 2023, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm. Reaching the Avengers Compound, he
            explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing the Quantum Realm allows time
            travel,
            they ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the
            present.
            Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time
            machine.
            Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate
            realities.
            Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and
            recruit
            an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante
            after
            the
            death of his family.
            <br>
            <br>
            Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012. At the
            Sanctum
            Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the
            various
            Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra
            sleeper
            agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with
            it.
            Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space
            Stone
            and
            encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and
            spies
            his
            lost love, Peggy Carter.

            <br>
            Meanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013; Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster,
            while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton,
            Romanoff,
            Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter
            Quill
            can, while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only
            be
            acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone.
            Rhodes
            and
            Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants
            link
            with
            her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to
            undo
            it.
            2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket
            had
            built. Having the most resistance to their radiation, Banner wields the gauntlet and reverses Thanos's
            disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to
            transport
            2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound.
            Present-day
            Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her.
            Thanos
            overpowers Stark, Thor, and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers and summons his army to retrieve the Stones,
            intent on
            using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other
            sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda
            and
            Asgard
            to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her
            and
            seizes
            the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, at the cost of
            his
            life.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians.
            Rogers
            returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains to live with Carter in the past. In
            the
            present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.
